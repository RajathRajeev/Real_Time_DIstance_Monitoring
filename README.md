# Real_Time_DIstance_Monitoring
OBJECTIVE:
To create a system that leverages Bluetooth technology to measure and display distance or proximity in real-time in a Bluetooth Terminal Application.

This project showcases the versatile use of commonly used electronic components, including the SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor, HC-05 Bluetooth Module, and Arduino Uno microcontroller, along with a Bluetooth Terminal application. These components work together to create an interactive and responsive environment. The SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor accurately measures distances by emitting ultrasonic pulses and calculating the time it takes for them to bounce back, enabling real-time distance monitoring. The HC-05 Bluetooth Module enables wireless communication with external devices, such as smartphones or tablets, through a Bluetooth Terminal application. Users can conveniently and flexibly control and monitor the system via Bluetooth for various applications. The Arduino Uno serves as the central processing unit, coordinating the integration of sensor data and Bluetooth communication. This project offers a practical example of combining these components to create a responsive and adaptable system, with potential applications in robotics, IoT, and home automation. The use of a Bluetooth Terminal application enhances user accessibility, making this project an excellent starting point for those interested in exploring the world of Arduino-based electronics and wireless communicatio
